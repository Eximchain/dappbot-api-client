# dappbot-types

Typescript bindings describing the core data types and API interactions with DappBot.  Extracted into their own repository in order to :

- Guarantee consistency across multiple client and server projects
- Make the overall DappBot codebase DRYer
- Share these types with our API customers

There is full generated documentation from the source code hosted at `eximchain.github.io/dappbot-types`.  Briefly, the types are grouped into nested namespaces in order to minimize both collisions and stuttering. They are nested like:

- `DappBotTypes`: Overall namespace, package's default export
  - `Dapp`: Interfaces, type guards, and factories related to the `DappItem` data type
  - `User`:  Interfaces, type guards, and factories related to the `User` & auth data types
  - `Responses`: Interfaces and helper functions for our API responses
  - `Methods`: Each sub-module within here (`Auth`, `Payment`, `Private`, `Public`) contains all types related to that resource's available methods.  Each method contains keys `Args`, `Result`, `Response`, `HTTP`, & `Path`.  The `Result` corresponds to the `res.data` in a successful call, `Response` just wraps that shape in `data`/`err`.

As a consumer, you can import either import the full namespace from the top or instead use the import string to grab one of the more nested ones.  All of the individual namespaces & types are declared within the `spec` folder, which you can directly refer to in your import.  By example, below are two ways of getting at the same type:

```typescript
// Grab the overall types object and drill down through
// the namespaces to get the interface we want
import Types from 'dappbot-types';
const argsFromType:Types.Methods.Auth.Login.Args = {
  username : 'wuddup',
  password : 'we here',
  yis : 'this prop is not legal and gets an error'
}

// Now we're going through the file structure to more
// directly grab the namespace with the types we're
// concerned about in this hypothetical file.
import { Login } from 'dappbot-types/spec/methods/auth';
const argsFromAuth:Login.Args = {
  username : "this object will have err because it's missing a property"
}
```

growl@1.10.5
MIT
# Growl for nodejs
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tj/node-growl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tj/node-growl)

Growl support for Nodejs. This is essentially a port of my [Ruby Growl Library](http://github.com/visionmedia/growl). Ubuntu/Linux support added thanks to [@niftylettuce](http://github.com/niftylettuce).

## Installation

### Install

### Mac OS X (Darwin):

  Install [growlnotify(1)](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify). On OS X 10.8, Notification Center is supported using [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier). To install:

    $ sudo gem install terminal-notifier

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

    $ npm install growl

### Ubuntu (Linux):

  Install `notify-send` through the [libnotify-bin](http://packages.ubuntu.com/libnotify-bin) package:

    $ sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

    $ npm install growl

### Windows:

  Download and install [Growl for Windows](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/default.aspx)

  Download [growlnotify](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/help/growlnotify.aspx) - **IMPORTANT :** Unpack growlnotify to a folder that is present in your path!

  Install [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and run:

    $ npm install growl

## Examples

Callback functions are optional

```javascript
var growl = require('growl')
growl('You have mail!')
growl('5 new messages', { sticky: true })
growl('5 new emails', { title: 'Email Client', image: 'Safari', sticky: true })
growl('Message with title', { title: 'Title'})
growl('Set priority', { priority: 2 })
growl('Show Safari icon', { image: 'Safari' })
growl('Show icon', { image: 'path/to/icon.icns' })
growl('Show image', { image: 'path/to/my.image.png' })
growl('Show png filesystem icon', { image: 'png' })
growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' })
growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' }, function(err){
  // ... notified
})
```

## Options

  - title
    - notification title
  - name
    - application name
  - priority
    - priority for the notification (default is 0)
  - sticky
    - weither or not the notification should remainin until closed
  - image
    - Auto-detects the context:
      - path to an icon sets --iconpath
      - path to an image sets --image
      - capitalized word sets --appIcon
      - filename uses extname as --icon
      - otherwise treated as --icon
  - exec
    - manually specify a shell command instead
      - appends message to end of shell command
      - or, replaces `%s` with message
      - optionally prepends title (example: `title: message`)
      - examples: `{exec: 'tmux display-message'}`, `{exec: 'echo "%s" > messages.log}`

# node-environment-flags

> Polyfill/shim for `process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags`

[![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

**node-environment-flags** is a *rough* polyfill and shim for [process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_allowednodeenvironmentflags), which was introduced in Node.js v10.10.0.

## Table of Contents

- [Install](#install)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Maintainers](#maintainers)
- [Contribute](#contribute)
- [License](#license)

## Install

*Requires Node.js v6.0.0 or newer.*

```shell
$ npm i node-environment-flags
```

## Usage

If the current Node.js version is v10.10.0 or newer, the native implementation will be provided instead.

### As Polyfill (Recommended)

```js
const nodeEnvironmentFlags = require('node-environment-flags');

nodeEnvironmentFlags.has('--require'); // true
```

### As Shim

```js
require('node-environment-flags/shim')();

process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags.has('--require'); // true
```

## Notes

- This module approximates what `process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags` provides in versions of Node.js prior to v10.10.0.  Since `process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags` is based on [`NODE_OPTIONS`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_options_options) (introduced in v8.0.0), the set of supported flags for versions older than v8.0.0 is *highly theoretical*.
- Version ranges are matched using [semver](https://npm.im/semver).
- This module is granular to the *minor* Node.js version number; *patch* version numbers are not considered.

yarn add react-request-hook axios

# NPM
npm install --save react-request-hook axios
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import {RequestProvider} from 'react-request-hook';
import axios from 'axios';

// More info about configuration: https://github.com/axios/axios#axioscreateconfig
const axiosInstance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://example.com/',
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <RequestProvider value={axiosInstance}>
    <App />
  </RequestProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

```jsx
// User Profile component
function UserProfile(props) {
  const [profile, getProfile] = useResource(id => ({
    url: `/user/${id}`,
    method: 'GET'
  })

  useEffect(() => getProfile(props.userId), [])

  if(profile.isLoading) return <Spinner />

  return (
    <ProfileScreen
      avatar={profile.data.avatar}
      email={profile.data.email}
      name={profile.data.name} />
  )
}
```

## Usage

### useResource

The `useResource` hook manages the request state under the hood. Its high-level API allows one request to be made at a time. Subsequent requests cancel the previous ones, leaving the call to be made with the most recent data available. The API is intended to be similar to `useState` and `useEffect`.

It requires a function as the first argument that is just a [request config][axios-request-config] factory and returns a tuple with the resource state and a function to trigger the request call, which accepts the same arguments as the factory one.

```tsx
const [comments, getComments] = useResource(id => ({
  url: `/post/${id}/comments`,
  method: 'get',
}));
```

The request function returns a canceler that allows you to easily cancel a request on a cleaning phase of a hook.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (props.isDialogOpen) {
    return getComments(props.postId);
  }
}, [props.isDialogOpen]);
```

```tsx
interface Resource {
  isLoading: boolean;

  // same as `response.data` resolved from the axios promise
  data: Payload<Request> | null;

  // Shortcut function to cancel a pending request
  cancel: (message?: string) => void;

  // normalized error
  error: RequestError | null;
}
```

The request can also be triggered passing its arguments as dependencies to the _useResource_ hook.

```tsx
const [comments] = useResource(
  (id: string) => ({
    url: `/post/${id}/comments`,
    method: 'get',
  }),
  [props.postId],
);
```

It has the same behavior as `useEffect`. Changing those values triggers another request and cancels the previous one if it's still pending.

If you want more control over the request calls or the ability to call multiple requests from the same resource or not at the same time, you can rely on the **useRequest** hook.

### useRequest

This hook is used internally by **useResource**. It's responsible for creating the request function and manage the cancel tokens that are being created on each of its calls. This hook also normalizes the error response (if any) and provides a helper that cancel all pending request.

It accepts the same function signature as `useResource` (a function that returns an object with the Axios request config).

```tsx
const [request, createRequest] = useRequest((id: string) => ({
  url: `/post/${id}/comments`,
  method: 'get',
}));
```

```tsx
interface CreateRequest {
  // same args used on the callback provided to the hook
  (...args): {
    // cancel the requests created on this factory
    cancel: (message?: string) => void;

    ready: () => Promise;
  };
}

interface Request {
  hasPending: boolean;

  // clear all pending requests
  clear: (message?: string) => void;
}
```

By using it, you're responsible for handling the promise resolution. It's still canceling pending requests when unmounting the component.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const {ready, cancel} = createRequest(props.postId);
  ready()
    .then(setState)
    .catch(error => {
      if (error.isCancel === false) {
        setError(error);
      }
    });
  return cancel;
}, [props.postId]);
```

### request

The `request` function allows you to define the response type coming from it. It also helps with creating a good pattern on defining your API calls and the expected results. It's just an identity function that accepts the request config and returns it. Both `useRequest` and `useResource` extract the expected and annotated type definition and resolve it on the `response.data` field.

```tsx
const api = {
  getUsers: () => {
    return request<Users>({
      url: '/users',
      method: 'GET',
    });
  },

  getUserPosts: (userId: string) => {
    return request<Posts>({
      url: `/users/${userId}/posts`,
      method: 'GET',
    });
  },
};
```

### createRequestError

The `createRequestError` normalizes the error response. This function is used internally as well. The `isCancel` flag is returned, so you don't have to call **axios.isCancel** later on the promise catch block.

```tsx
interface RequestError {
  // same as `response.data`, where response is the object coming from the axios promise
  data: Payload<Request>;

## Type safety for non typescript projects

This library is entirely written in typescript, so depending on your editor you might have all the type hints out of the box. However, we also provide a payload field to be attached to the request config object, which allows you to define and use the typings for the payload of a given request. We believe that this motivates a better and clean code as we're dealing with some of the most substantial parts of our app implementation.

```js
const api = {
  getUsers: () => {
    return {
      url: '/users',
      method: 'GET',
      payload: [{
        id: String(),
        age: Number(),
        likesVideoGame: Boolean(),
      }],
    });
  },
};
```

And you'll have

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schettino/react-request-hook/master/other/type-hint.png">
</p>

## Example

You can try out react-request-hook right in your browser with the [Codesandbox example][codesandbox].

The example folder contains a `/components` folder with different use cases, like infinite scrolling components, search input that triggers the API, and so on. It's currently a work in progress.

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to @kentcdodds for making this implementation a lot easier to test. [create-react-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library) for the initial setup and [Grommet](https://github.com/grommet/grommet) with its great components used in the examples.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
